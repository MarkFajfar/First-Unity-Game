    Cards together. \n2. Find cards #46 through #50 and arrange in numerical order
    from left to right (with #46 on the far left and #50 on the far right). Cards46-49
    are Historical Event cards, card #50 is a Transitional Event. \n3. Flip these
    5 cards over so they are face-down and deal 8 Operations/Ceremony cards (face-down)
    to each. \n4. Individually shuffle all five 9-card stacks, but don\u2019t combine.
    \n5. Starting with the left stack (the stack containing card #46), place each
    stack on top of the other\u2014moving from left to right. So the final 45-card
    deck will have the 9-card set containing card #46 on top, and the 9-card set
    containing card #50 on the bottom. And within each set the cards are shuffled."
