  Setup:
  - "Place Starting Families In Play: \nA, B, C (any Ferocity) in any Area of Shiprock,
    San Juan Valley, and Canyon de Chelly. \nPlace a man, woman, and child counter
    in each Family's Family Box. \nPlace all remaining Family Counters into the holding
    spaces of each Family Box."
  - "Place Starting Elders In Play: \nPlace 1 elder counter into each of the 3 leftmost
    boxes of the Elder Display."
  - "Prepare Draw Cups: \nPlace all Corn counters into a clean empty container from
    which they can be drawn during play. \nDo the same with the Intruder counters."
  - "Prepare Raid Pool: \nPrepare the Raid Pool by placing 3 black, 3 brown, 3 red,
    3 white, 2 yellow, and 1 green cube into the draw bag; return all other cubes
    to the game box."
  - "Prepare Cultural Development Cards: \nSelect 1 set of 3 Cultural Development
    Cards to be available for use in the game. \nCollect the remaining 7 Level 1
    Cultural Development Cards and shuffle them. \nDraw three Cultural Development
    Cards and set them along with the Level 2 and 3 cards from their set back into
    the box."
  - "General Records Track: \nMilitary Points: 5 \nEnemy Ferocity: 4 \nCulture Points:
    9 \nDin\xE9 APs: 3 \nMorale: 5"
  - "Remove Trade Goods & Harass Counters: \nSet 6 Trade Goods and 2 Harass counters
    off to the side. They are neither in play, nor available. They become available
    when a Weaving or the Masters of the Mesas Cultural Development Card is purchased."
  - "Set Up Resources: \nPlace all remaining Population counters, animals, Trade
    Goods, Harass counters, and the Firearms counter in the Out of Play Box."
  - "Set Up Enemy Instruction Display:\nPlace all Spanish (yellow) Instruction counters
    into a cup and randomly draw 2 of them out. \nReturn the 2 drawn counters to
    the box; they will not be used this game. "
  - Next, place all remaining Spanish Instruction counters face-up (capital letter
    id) on to the Active and Standby columns of the Enemy Instruction Display in
    alphabetical order, from top to bottom, filling the Active Column first.
  - "Set Up Enemy Pieces: \nPlace all Mission Outpost counters, Enemy AP counters,
    and Tribal Raid counters in the Enemy Out of Play box."
  - "Collect Starting Cultural Development Card: \nCollect one available Level 1
    Cultural Development Card and place it face-up along the bottom edge of the map,
    signifying that its effects are in play for the rest of the game (note that this
    is Free and does NOT cost any Culture Points)."
  - "Note Victory Conditions: \nIf the game does not end in defeat beforehand, determine
    victory or defeat after card #45 Mexican Independence is resolved. \nFor each
    black cube in Subjugation of New Mexico box, add +1 Enemy Morale. Next, subtract
    the number of Enemy Morale from Military Points and compare the difference on
    the table on the next screen."
  - "Major Victory:  3 or higher  \r\nMinor Victory:  1 or 2             \r\nMinor
    Defeat:   0, \u20131, or \u20132  \r\nMajor Defeat:   \u20133 or less"
  - "To prepare the deck for this scenario: \n1.Shuffle all Operations & Ceremony
    Cards together. \n2. Find cards #41 through #45 and arrange in numerical order
    from left to right (with #41 on the far left and #45 on the far right). Cards
    41-44 are Historical Event cards, card #45 is a Transitional Event. "
  - "3. Flip these 5 cards over so they are face-down and deal 8 Operation/Ceremony
    cards (face-down) to each.\n4. Individually shuffle all five 9-card stacks\u2014but
    don\u2019t combine."
  - "5. Starting with the left stack (the stack containing card #41), place each
    stack on top of the other\u2014moving from left to right. So the final 45-card
    deck will have the 9-card set containing card #41 on top, and the 9-card set
    containing card #45 on the bottom. And within each set the cards are shuffled."
  - END
