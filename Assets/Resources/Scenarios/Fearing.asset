    or defeat after card #55 Kit Carson is resolved: For each black cube in Subjugation
    of New Mexico box, add +1 Enemy Morale. Next, subtract the number of Enemy Morale
    from Military Points and compare the difference on the table below. \nMilitary
    Pts > Enemy Morale: Major Victory \n1+ Military Pt and Military Pts = Enemy Morale:
    Minor Victory \n1+ Military Pt and Military Pts < Enemy Morale: Minor Defeat
    [Historical] \n0 Military Pts and 0 Enemy Morale: Minor Defeat \n0 Military Pts
    and 1+ Enemy Morale: Major Defeat"
  - "To prepare the deck for this scenario: \n1. Shuffle all Operations & Ceremony
    Cards together. \n2. Find cards #51 through #55 and arrange in numerical order
    from left to right (with #51 on the far left and #55 on the far right). Cards
    51-54 are Historical Event cards, card #55 is a Transitional Event. \n3. Flip
    these 5 cards over so they are face-down and deal 8 Operations/Ceremony cards
    to each. \n4. Individually shuffle all five 9-card stacks, but don\u2019t combine.
    \n5.Starting with the left stack (the stack containing card #51), place each
    stack on top of the other, moving from left to right. So the final 45-card deck
    will have the 9-card set containing card #51 on top, and the 9-card set containing
    card #55 on the bottom. And within each set the cards are shuffled."
